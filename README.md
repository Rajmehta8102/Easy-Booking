# Easy-Booking
Easy Booking is an advanced hotel management and booking system that facilitates hotel reservations, availability checks, and hotel reviews.

This project follows a microservice architecture, primarily comprising four key services: user service, hotel service, booking service, and rating service. Additionally, there is a service registry and API gateway that consolidate access to all services through a single port.

A configuration server is also implemented, leveraging GitHub to centralize shared application configurations. This setup enhances scalability and reduces redundancy in the application properties files across the distributed server architecture.
